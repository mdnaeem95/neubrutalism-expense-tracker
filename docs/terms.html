  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective date: February 10, 2026</p>

  <p>By downloading or using Ledgr ("the app"), you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>Ledgr is a personal expense tracking tool. You may use it for lawful, personal purposes. You are responsible for all data you enter into the app.</p>

  <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ledgr offers a free tier with core features and a premium subscription ("Ledgr Premium") with additional features.</li>
    <li>Premium subscriptions are billed monthly ($2.99/month) or yearly ($24.99/year) through your Apple App Store account.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
    <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device's Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions.</li>
    <li>No refunds are provided for partial billing periods. Refund requests should be directed to Apple.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Advertisements</h2>
  <p>Free-tier users may see advertisements served by Google AdMob. Premium subscribers enjoy an ad-free experience.</p>

  <h2>4. Data and Backups</h2>
  <p>All data is stored locally on your device. We are not responsible for data loss due to device failure, app deletion, or other circumstances. We recommend using the CSV export feature to back up important data.</p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>Ledgr is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee the app will be error-free or uninterrupted. Ledgr is not a financial advisor — the app is a tracking tool and does not provide financial advice.</p>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to data loss or financial decisions made based on information in the app.</p>

  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content, design, and code in Ledgr are owned by us. You may not copy, modify, or distribute the app or its components without permission.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about these terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:naeem@ledgr.app">naeem@ledgr.app</a>.</p>
