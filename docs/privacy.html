  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective date: February 10, 2026</p>

  <p>Ledgr ("we", "our", or "the app") is a personal expense tracking application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data Ledgr collects, how it is used, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All expense data, categories, budgets, and settings are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using an on-device SQLite database. We do not operate servers that store your personal financial data.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or account credentials.</li>
    <li>We do not access your bank accounts or financial institutions.</li>
    <li>We do not sell, share, or transmit your expense data to any third party.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Ledgr integrates the following third-party services, each with their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — Manages in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect anonymous purchase data and device identifiers to process transactions. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — Displays advertisements to free-tier users. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data for ad personalization. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>

  </ul>

  <h2>4. Camera and Photo Library</h2>
  <p>Ledgr requests camera and photo library permissions solely to allow you to attach receipt photos to expenses. These images are stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to any server.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Export</h2>
  <p>You may export your expense data as a CSV file using the in-app export feature. The exported file is generated locally and shared via your device's native share sheet. We do not receive a copy of exported data.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Ledgr is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
